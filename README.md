# Data

To get the datasets:

Twitter data (Tweets):  Please refer to the Twitter API / Tutorials: [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/getting-historical-tweets-using-the-full-archive-search-endpoint).

NFT transaction data:  Use Google BigQuery, put the address of the contract, for example, to get the transactions of BAYC:
```
SELECT contracts.address, contracts.is_erc721, contracts.is_erc20,
token_trs.from_address, token_trs.to_address, token_trs.value, token_trs.transaction_hash, transactions.value as transaction_value, transactions.hash, token_trs.log_index, token_trs.block_timestamp
FROM `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.contracts` AS contracts
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.token_transfers` AS token_trs ON (token_trs.token_address = contracts.address)
JOIN `bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum.transactions` AS transactions ON (transactions.hash = token_trs.transaction_hash)
where contracts.address = '0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d'
ORDER BY token_trs.block_timestamp DESC
```
